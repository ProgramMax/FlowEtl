This is a framework designed for the creation of testable components which can
be interconnected via arbitrary inputs and outputs and those components can
be executed in the correct order (inputs satisfied before running) automatically.
This is useful since it aids developers in thinking in the paradigm where they plan components
ahead of time, allowing for simpler reuse and refactoring later. At yahoo! this
was created for a ETL like framework & pipeline, but its applications are not 
limited to solely that, since the concept itself is generic.

* Future developments
   - Integrate more services
   - Multi-threaded planning and execution
   - More tests!

The FlowEtl project uses several 3rd party open source libraries and tools.
This file summarizes the tools used, their purpose, and the licenses under which
they're released.

Except as specifically stated below, the 3rd party software packages are not
distributed as part of this project, but instead are separately downloaded from
the respective provider and built on the developerâ€™s machine as a pre-build
step.
